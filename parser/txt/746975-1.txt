Doucoure, DjabyTESTS ADMINISTERED: (The following tests were selected step-wise based on a combination 
of the patient’s condition, outcomes of the previous testing, and clinical indicationBesides 
confirming differential diagnoses from various points of view, the tests give invaluable 
information for effective treatment planning)1Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-2) 
2Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)  
3The Beck  Hopelessness Scale ( BHS ) 
4Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5) 
5Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) 
6Quality of Life Inventory (QLI) 
7Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test (M-Fast)
8Clinical Interview
TEST RESULTS:
1Beck Depression Inventory BDI-II  
Beck Depression Inventory has become one of the most clinically accepted instruments for 
assessing the severity of depression in diagnosed patients and for detecting levels of consciously 
admitted depression regardless of the clinical populationThe BDI-II was developed as an 
indicator of the presence and degree of depressive symptoms consistent with DSM-VMrDoucoure’s score of 50 indicates that he consciously admits to severe levels of clinical 
depressionNo suicidal thoughts or plans were mentioned at this time2Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)  
The BAI consists of twenty-one questions about how the subject has been feeling in the last 
month, expressed as common symptoms of anxiety (such as numbness and tingling, sweating not 
due to heat, and fear of the worst happening)Anxiety can be thought of as having several 
components, including cognitive, somatic, affective, and behavioral componentsMrDoucoure’s score of 30 indicates that he consciously admits high levels of clinical 
anxiety accompanied by an inability to relax, and fear of the worst happening3The Beck  Hopelessness Scale ( BHS )
The BHS is a 20-item developed to measure three major aspects of hopelessness: feelings 
about the future, loss of motivation, and expectationsMrDoucoure’s scores of 10 show 
moderate to severe pessimism and negative attitudes about the future55 West 39th Street Suite 305, NYC, 10018 and 91-31 Queen BlvSuite 308, Elmhursrt, NY 11373

Doucoure, Djaby4Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5)
The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report checklist of PTSD symptoms based closely on the 
DSM-V criteriaRespondents rate each item from 0 ("not at all") to 4 ("extremely") to indicate 
the degree to which they have been bothered by that particular symptom over the past monthTypically, it is optimal to assess traumatic event exposureA total score of 33 or higher suggests 
the patient may benefit from PTSD treatmentOverall, MrDoucoure’s score of 58 indicates significant traumatic event sequelaePlease note, even though he might have suffered from PTSD before, it seems that his symptoms 
got better5Pain Self-Efficacy  Questionnaire (PSEQ)
PSEQ assesses patients’ views of their ability to manage their painThe ten items assess how 
confident patients are that they can do things at present despite the painIt covers a range of 
functions, including house chores, socializing, work, and coping with pain without medicationThe scores range from 0 to 60; the higher the score, the better the prognosticA score of 19 indicates that MrDoucoure  has a fair self-efficacy belief; which means that he 
is somehow confident in his ability to manage the pain6Quality of Life Inventory (QLI) 
The Quality of life inventory is 33 items for assessing patients’ well-being and life 
satisfactionMrDoucoure’s responses indicated he was not very satisfied with his life overallHe endorsed several items of importance to him, which included health, medical care, amount of 
pain, amount of energy, capacity to help self, control over own life, life longevity, family health, 
children, family happiness, sexual life, partner, friendships, emotional support, responsibilities, 
usefulness to others, amount of worries in life, neighborhood, home or residence, employment, 
education, finances, have fun, a chance for a happy future, peace of mind, faith, meeting goals, 
overall happiness, life satisfaction, personal appearance, and self in generalHe feels very 
frustrated, as he cannot achieve daily goals8Structured Inventory of Malingered Symptomatology (SIMS-TM) 
The SIMS-TM is a 75 items test that assesses five distinct areasThis test is a multi-axial, 
self-administered measure developed to serve as a screening tool for the detection of feigned or 
exaggerated psychiatric and cognitive disturbance across a variety of clinical and forensic 
settingsThe two relevant areas for the psychological scope are Psychoses and Affective 
DisordersMrDoucoure scored 2 (cut off  >1 to 2) on the Psychosis scale and 5 (cut off >5 to 6) 
in the Affective Disorders, showing no psychological symptoms, exaggeration, or malingering55 West 39th Street Suite 305, NYC, 10018 and 91-31 Queen BlvSuite 308, Elmhursrt, NY 11373

Doucoure, Djaby8Clinical InterviewsFindings from the interviews themselves corroborate the testing hypothesesMoreover, MrDoucoure’s reaction to the stress of the accident, as reported in interviews, emerges as a 
causative factor of present debilityDISCUSSION OF TEST RESULTS:
MrDoucoure  appears to be presently functioning on the average native endowment 
range of cognitive intelligenceMrDoucoure’s attention, concentration, and memory 
functioning all seem to be slightly affectedResponses to BDI-2, BAI, PCL-5, M-Fast, and QLI 
combined with a clinical interview, support underlying processes of depression and anxiety in a 
non-psychotic patientDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:
(F0630) Mood Disorder due to Medical Condition
(F064) Anxiety Disorder Due to the medical condition 
(F0781) Post Concussion Syndrome
With a reasonable degree of certainty, MrDoucoure’s psychological condition is 
consequentially related to injuries sustained in a work-related accident that occurred on 
03/09/20From a psychological point of view, he has a marked temporary disability of 75% 
at this timeRECOMMENDATIONS:
The following psychological treatment is recommended: The course of treatment should be first 
directed toward his mood disorder and anxietyOnce the recommended treatment ends he 
should be assessed for PTSD14 sessions of psychotherapy for Mood Disorder and Anxiety: MrDoucoure should be 
given the benefit of a course in Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT); Acceptance Commitment 
Therapy (ACT); and the use of Mindfulness ExercisesThis line of therapy is directed toward 
shoring up Pt’s sense of self, helping MrDoucoure  to cope with feelings of helplessness and 
symptoms of depression and anxiety; teaching cognitive and behavioral coping skills (eg, 
cognitive restructuring, activity pacing, mood check, etc); as well as practice and consolidation 
of coping skills (eg, pain and anger management)55 West 39th Street Suite 305, NYC, 10018 and 91-31 Queen BlvSuite 308, Elmhursrt, NY 11373
