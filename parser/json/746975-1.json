Besidesconfirming differential diagnoses from various points of view, the tests give invaluableinformation for effective treatment planning).1. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-2)2. Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)3. The Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)4. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5)5. Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ)6. Quality of Life Inventory (QLD)7. Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test (M-Fast)8. Clinical InterviewTEST RESULTS:1. Beck Depression Inventory BDI-IIBeck Depression Inventory has become one of the most clinically accepted instruments forassessing the severity of depression in diagnosed patients and for detecting levels of consciouslyadmitted depression regardless of the clinical population. The BDI-II was developed as anindicator of the presence and degree of depressive symptoms consistent with DSM-V.Mr. Doucoure\u2019s score of 50 indicates that he consciously admits to severe levels of clinicaldepression. No suicidal thoughts or plans were mentioned at this time.2. Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)The BAI consists of twenty-one questions about how the subject has been feeling in the lastmonth, expressed as common symptoms of anxiety (such as numbness and tingling, sweating notdue to heat, and fear of the worst happening). Anxiety can be thought of as having severalcomponents, including cognitive, somatic, affective, and behavioral components.Mr. Doucoure\u2019s score of 30 indicates that he consciously admits high levels of clinicalanxiety accompanied by an inability to relax, and fear of the worst happening.3. The Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)The BHS is a 20-item developed to measure three major aspects of hopelessness: feelingsabout the future, loss of motivation, and expectations. Mr. Doucoure\u2019s scores of 10 showmoderate to severe pessimism and negative attitudes about the future.Doucoure, DjabyJM DA SILIACAL SERVPSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES55 West 39\" Street Suite 305, NYC, 10018 and 91-31 Queen Bly. Suite 308, Elmhursrt, NY 11373Phone: (917) 677-9070  e-Fax: (917) 725-80444. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5)The PCL-S5 is a 20-item self-report checklist of PTSD symptoms based closely on theDSM-V criteria. Respondents rate each item from 0 (\"not at all\") to 4 (\"extremely\") to indicatethe degree to which they have been bothered by that particular symptom over the past month.Typically, it is optimal to assess traumatic event exposure. A total score of 33 or higher suggeststhe patient may benefit from PTSD treatment.Overall, Mr. Doucoure\u2019s score of 58 indicates significant traumatic event sequelae.Please note, even though he might have suffered from PTSD before, it seems that his symptomsgot better.5. Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEPSEQ assesses patients\u2019 views of their ability to manage their pain. The ten items assess howconfident patients are that they can do things at present despite the pain. It covers a range offunctions, including house chores, socializing, work, and coping with pain without medication.The scores range from 0 to 60; the higher the score, the better the prognostic.A score of 19 indicates that Mr. Doucoure has a fair self-efficacy belief; which means that heis somehow confident in his ability to manage the pain.6. Quality of Life Invento LIThe Quality of life inventory is 33 items for assessing patients\u2019 well-being and lifesatisfaction. Mr. Doucoure\u2019s responses indicated he was not very satisfied with his life overall.He endorsed several items of importance to him, which included health, medical care, amount ofpain, amount of energy, capacity to help self, control over own life, life longevity, family health,children, family happiness, sexual life, partner, friendships, emotional support, responsibilities,usefulness to others, amount of worries in life, neighborhood, home or residence, employment,education, finances, have fun, a chance for a happy future, peace of mind, faith, meeting goals,overall happiness, life satisfaction, personal appearance, and self in general. He feels veryfrustrated, as he cannot achieve daily goals.8. Structured Inventory of Malingered Symptomatology (SIMS-TM)The SIMS-TM is a 75 items test that assesses five distinct areas. This test is a multi-axial,self-administered measure developed to serve as a screening tool for the detection of feigned orexaggerated psychiatric and cognitive disturbance across a variety of clinical and forensicsettings. The two relevant areas for the psychological scope are Psychoses and AffectiveDisorders. Mr. Doucoure scored 2 (cut off >1 to 2) on the Psychosis scale and 5 (cut off >5 to 6)in the Affective Disorders, showing no psychological symptoms, exaggeration, or malingering.Doucoure, DjabyJM DA SILIACAL SERVPSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES55 West 39\" Street Suite 305, NYC, 10018 and 91-31 Queen Bly. Suite 308, Elmhursrt, NY 11373Phone: (917) 677-9070  e-Fax: (917) 725-80448. Clinical Interviews.Findings from the interviews themselves corroborate the testing hypotheses. Moreover, Mr.Doucoure\u2019s reaction to the stress of the accident, as reported in interviews, emerges as acausative factor of present debility.DISCUSSION OF TEST RESULTS:Mr. Doucoure appears to be presently functioning on the average native endowmentrange of cognitive intelligence. Mr. Doucoure\u2019s attention, concentration, and memoryfunctioning all seem to be slightly affected. Responses to BDI-2, BAI, PCL-5, M-Fast, and QLIcombined with a clinical interview, support underlying processes of depression and anxiety in anon-psychotic patient.DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:(F06.30) Mood Disorder due to Medical Condition(F06.4) Anxiety Disorder Due to the medical condition(F07.81) Post Concussion SyndromeWith a reasonable degree of certainty, Mr. Doucoure\u2019s psychological condition isconsequentially related to injuries sustained in a work-related accident that occurred on03/09/20. From a psychological point of view, he has a marked temporary disability of 75%at this time.RECOMMENDATIONS:The following psychological treatment is recommended: The course of treatment should be firstdirected toward his mood disorder and anxiety. Once the recommended treatment ends heshould be assessed for PTSD.14 sessions of psychotherapy for Mood Disorder and Anxiety: Mr. Doucoure should begiven the benefit of a course in Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT); Acceptance CommitmentTherapy (ACT); and the use of Mindfulness Exercises. This line of therapy is directed towardshoring up Pt\u2019s sense of self, helping Mr. Doucoure to cope with feelings of helplessness andsymptoms of depression and anxiety; teaching cognitive and behavioral coping skills (e.g.,cognitive restructuring, activity pacing, mood check, etc.); as well as practice and consolidationof coping skills (e.g., pain and anger management).Doucoure, DjabyJM DA SILIARVPSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES55 West 39\" Street Suite 305, NYC, 10018 and 91-31 Queen Bly.
